If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
To get the average of energy, valence and danceability to set the mood, I would write:
SELECT AVG((energy+valence+danceability)/3) from songs;
This takes the average of each column and then the average for the three columns, and just as the
situation suggets, the averages of these values return the mood.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
I think that just three values don't completely define the mood. Using more columns for the average
would help to define the better for the mood. Besides energy, valence and danceability, I would include
the tempo and the loudness. Addionaly, the key used for the song creates a tone generally, so the number
of the key can also help to identify what is the overall mood.
